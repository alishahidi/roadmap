import MessagingChart from '@site/src/components/MessagingChart';

This section transitions from abstract patterns to the concrete tools and frameworks you'll use to implement them. We'll explore the Spring Cloud ecosystem for building microservices, specialized frameworks like Axon for CQRS, and the critical choice of messaging systems like Kafka and RabbitMQ.

## Chapter 7: The Spring Cloud Toolkit

A suite of tools for common patterns in distributed systems:

- **Service Discovery (Eureka):** Helps services find each other dynamically.
- **API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway):** Single entry point for routing, auth, and rate limiting.
- **Configuration (Spring Cloud Config):** Centralized configuration management.
- **Fault Tolerance (Resilience4j):** Implements patterns like Circuit Breaker to prevent cascading failures.

## Chapter 8: The Axon Framework

A specialized Java framework purpose-built for applications that follow DDD, CQRS, and Event Sourcing patterns. It provides annotations and building blocks (`@Aggregate`, `CommandGateway`, `EventStore`) that dramatically accelerate development by handling the complex plumbing code for you.

## Chapter 9: Messaging Systems: Kafka vs. RabbitMQ

The choice of message broker is a critical architectural decision. The interactive chart below illustrates a key trade-off: Kafka's log-based architecture gives it superior throughput for high-volume data streams, while RabbitMQ's smart routing excels in complex messaging scenarios.

| Criterion   | Apache Kafka              | RabbitMQ                  |
|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Model** | Event Streaming Platform  | Message Broker            |
| **Retention** | Durable, Replayable       | Transient                 |
| **Routing** | Simple (Dumb Broker)      | Complex (Smart Broker)    |
| **Use Case** | Event Sourcing, Data Pipelines | Task Queues, Complex Routing |
